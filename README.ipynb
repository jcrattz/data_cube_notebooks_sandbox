    "## CEOS Open Data Cube Sandbox Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEOS Open Data Cube Sandbox Notebooks is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks using the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) to analyze satellite data. These are modified versions of the [CEOS Open Data Cube Notebooks](https://github.com/ceos-seo/data_cube_notebooks) - mainly changed to accommodate differences in data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the notebooks here are part of the [Data Cube Applications Library (DCAL)](https://www.opendatacube.org/dcal), which demonstrate how to perform several common tasks in geospatial analyses such as calculating spectral indices, obtaining time-series composites (or \"mosaics\"), detecting water, and more."
